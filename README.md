# Investigate a TMDB Dataset
In this project, I analyzed the TMDb movie dataset by using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset, which is originally from Kaggle, was cleaned and provided by Udacity. The dataset contains 5000+ movies basic information and some metrics that measured can be classified how successful these movies are. These metrics include popularity, revenue and vote average. Basic information are like cast, director, keywords, runtime, genres, etc. The goal for this project is to go through the general data analysis process project. And the research I investigated is focus on finding properties that are associated with successful movies as well as some interesting trends.
# Overview
This is a data analysis project and the goal is analyze the TMDB Movies dataset which will be used to explain and go through the data analysis process. This project will mainly make use of the following python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. This Process includes five(5) process :

-Questions Asked

-Data Wrangling

-Exploratory Data Analysis

-Conclusions

-Communication and Presentation

The TMDB Movie Dataset was originally cleaned from the original on Kaggle and it contains information on about 10000 movies which includes the user ratings, revenue, budget and popularity which will be used to analyse the movie dataset. The dataset covers from 1966 to 2015.

# QUESTIONS ASKED


-Which gernes are most popular


-Average popularity of movies overtime


-Properties associated with movies that have the highest revenue
# Conclusions

At part one, I analysed trend popularity of movies overtime. it was concluded that movies started becoming popular in the later years of 2010 to 2015. the average popularity of movies increased over the years.

Part two: Which gernes are most popular, this part revealed that drama had the highest number of movies and aslo analysing the popularity of movies by genres, adventure was the most popular followed by science fiction movies.

Part three: Properties associated with movies that have the highest revenue after analysing the revenue data, it was revealed that the average revenue increased overtime. -Movies with higher popularity have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues. -Movies with higher budgets have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues. -it also shows that runtime has no correlation with increase in revenue
